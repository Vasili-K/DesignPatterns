# Creational Design Patterns

### provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

These patterns help to make a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. They increase the system's flexibility in terms of object creation by enabling code to be more generalized and not dependent on the specific classes of objects that need to be created.

## Factory Method

#### is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
[Refactoring Guru: Factory Method](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/factory-method)

The main idea of the pattern is to delegate the creation of class instances to subclasses, which increases flexibility and code reuse.

## Abstract Factory

#### is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.
[Refactoring Guru: Abstract Factory](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/abstract-factory)

Essentially, it delegates the responsibility of instantiating a class to subclasses, which can be useful for managing a family of objects without specifying their concrete classes.
